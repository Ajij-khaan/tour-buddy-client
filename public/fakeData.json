A national park may be set aside for purposes of public recreation and enjoyment or because of its historical or scientific interest. Most of the landscapes and their accompanying plants and animals in a national park are kept in their natural state. The national parks in the United States and Canada tend to focus on the protection of both land and wildlife, those in the United Kingdom focus mainly on the land, and those in Africa primarily exist to conserve animals.

        "description": "The universe is a dark forest. Every civilization is an armed hunter stalking through the trees like a ghost, gently pushing aside branches that block the path and trying to tread without sound. Even breathing is done with care. The hunter has to be careful, because everywhere in the forest are stealthy hunters like him. If he finds other life—another hunter, an angel or a demon, a delicate infant or a tottering old man, a fairy or a demigod—there’s only one thing he can do: open fire and eliminate them. In this forest, hell is other people. An eternal threat that any life that exposes its own existence will be swiftly wiped out. This is the picture of cosmic civilization. It’s the explanation for the Fermi Paradox",

In Ruislip, West London, a 700-acre woodland nature reserve is home to a gorgeous natural lake, with a genuine sandy beach. Woodland trails, a miniature train, and pirate ship for kids are also on offer, but despite what you may see in the photo above, swimming is technically not permitted. There is, however, a very cool miniature train that’ll whizz you around the lake! Nearest stations are Ruislip and Northwood Hills, Zone 6 – it’s then a 20-minute walk.",

The square has been gradually built up since that point and has been used for official ceremonies by all Russian governments since it was established",
